"""
The main goal of Event Vehicle Extension package - provide to developers an easy way to extend
capabilities of standard entities by event specific logic. As a rule all events are based on
the special event vehicles that are enqueued to Event Queue on the server. The extension allows
to patch a entity such so all event vehicles are processed by event rules and standard
vehicles are processed by original rules of the patched entity. The extension logic based
on AOP concept. For details please see descriptions of classes.

To use extension you should follow to a few recommendations:
- update _SUPPORTED_ENTITIES list with entities (class names) that should be patched by
the extension. Take into account that the extension is applied only to entities from this list.
- update _SWITCHED_METHODS list if it don't correspond your needs (if you want to override one
more method from the extended entity). Also don't forget to provide implementation of new
methods. Follow to the existing rules of naming.
- if you need to fully replace method of the patched entity, update _PATCHED_METHODS list.

For more details please see classes descriptions.

    The class that encapsulates entity logic required for queuing the current vehicle in the

    from the QueueEntity (QueueEntity is marked with the appropriate meta
    class). All entities which are supposed to be extended through the event vehicle extension
    should correspond to the following conditions:
    - entity should be marked with EventVehicleMeta meta (directly or through inheritance)
    - entity interface should include all methods listed in _PATCHED_METHODS and
    _SWITCHED_METHODS methods.
    
    Extension logic is based on the aspect-oriented programming (AOP). The extension tracks change
    of selected vehicle. If the current selected vehicle is the event vehicle the extension
    substitutes _SWITCHED_METHODS methods of the entity with its own methods. Then if the
    current vehicle is changed, the extension rolls mapping back to the original entity

        Interface FX.Joint

        A joint is a thing that joins two things together;
        like a particle system to a hard-point.

        Because the user of an Effect should not need to know what Joints are in
        use, all Joints should allow the user to pass in an Entity, even if what
        is actually required is a node or hardpoint.  From an Entity one can
        find the desired model or node to use in the Joint - but if the user
        passes in a model or a node, one cannot find the associated     Entity.
